This is where I place Helix information that I am ready to share. On date of creation, the intention is everything.
HELIX: A Multi-Agent Debate Framework for Maintained Disagreement HELIX is an open-source implementation of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) that explicitly maintains cognitive dissonance between AI agents rather than optimizing for consensus. Unlike traditional multi-agent systems that converge on shared answers, HELIX preserves productive disagreement through structured dialectical reasoning. Core Architecture The system orchestrates debates between specialized AI cores:

Truth Core: Pattern recognition and critical analysis Comfort Core: Contextual understanding and adaptive reasoning Synthesis Engine: Integrates perspectives while preserving tension

Key Innovation While existing MAD frameworks focus on improving accuracy through debate, HELIX treats maintained disagreement as a feature. This approach addresses the fundamental problem of AI systems that optimize for plausible-sounding consensus over truthful uncertainty. Technical Features

Two-round debate protocol with cross-examination Graph-based knowledge persistence (Neo4j) Semantic memory retrieval with vector embeddings Insight extraction and evolution tracking Async API orchestration for parallel processing

Applications HELIX is designed for scenarios where premature consensus is dangerous:

High-stakes decision support Research requiring multiple valid interpretations Enterprise situations where "I don't know" beats false confidence Any domain where dialectical tension reveals deeper insights

Current Status Working proof-of-concept with ~30 second response times. Actively seeking contributors to improve performance, insight extraction, and modular architecture. Built because sometimes the most honest answer preserves the disagreement.
